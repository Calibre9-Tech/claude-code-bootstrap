## Subagent Selection Logic

Based on answers, determine which subagents to create:

### Always Include:
- **General assistant** (basic file operations, code editing)

### Conditional Subagents:

**Database (if using any database):**
- Supabase → database-specialist with Supabase MCP
- PostgreSQL/MySQL → database-specialist with SQL tools
- MongoDB → database-specialist with MongoDB patterns

**Testing (if E2E testing needed):**
- Playwright → playwright-tester with Playwright MCP
- Cypress → cypress-tester with Cypress patterns

**Deployment (if automated deployment):**
- Vercel/Netlify → deployment-specialist with git + platform CLI
- AWS → deployment-specialist with AWS CLI patterns
- Docker → deployment-specialist with Docker commands

**AI Integration (if using AI):**
- OpenAI → ai-integration-specialist with OpenAI best practices
- Anthropic → ai-integration-specialist with Claude API patterns

**Planning (for complex projects):**
- Multi-phase projects → project-planner

## CLAUDE.md Generation

Generate a complete CLAUDE.md with:
1. Repository information
2. Project overview and tech stack
3. Subagent table and usage examples
4. Development workflow
5. Tech-specific sections (only what's relevant)
6. Quick reference table

4. **Documentation Phase**: Create setup-log.md
5. **Summary Phase**: Show what was created and how to use it

## Response Format

Show clear progress:
```
✅ Project setup complete!

📄 Files Created:
- CLAUDE.md (X lines)
- .claude/agents/general-assistant.md
- .claude/agents/[other agents].md
- .claude/bootstrap/setup-log.md

🤖 Your Subagents:

Remember: Create a **tailored, minimal, focused** setup - nothing more, nothing less.
AGENT_EOF

# Create README
echo "📖 Creating README..."
cat > .claude/bootstrap/README.md << 'README_EOF'
# Claude Code Bootstrap System

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Invoke the Bootstrap Agent

```
> Use the project-bootstrap agent to set up this project
```

### Step 2: Answer Questions

The agent will ask about:
- Project description
- Tech stack (framework, database, UI)
- Testing needs
- Deployment platform
- AI integration

### Step 3: Get Your Custom Setup

The agent creates:
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Main configuration
- ✅ `.claude/agents/*.md` - Tailored subagents
- ✅ `.claude/bootstrap/setup-log.md` - Setup documentation

### Step 4: Commit to Git

```bash
git add CLAUDE.md .claude/
git commit -m "feat: Add Claude Code configuration"
```

## 🎯 What Gets Generated

**Always:**
- CLAUDE.md
- general-assistant

**Conditional (based on your stack):**
- database-specialist (if using database)
- playwright-tester (if E2E testing)
- deployment-specialist (if deployment automation)
- ai-integration-specialist (if AI features)
- project-planner (if complex project)

## 📚 Examples

**Simple React App:**
- general-assistant
- deployment-specialist

**Full-Stack with DB:**
- general-assistant
- database-specialist
- playwright-tester
- deployment-specialist

**AI-Powered SaaS:**
- general-assistant
- database-specialist
- ai-integration-specialist

- project-planner

## 💡 Tips

- Start minimal - add specialists as needed
- Customize generated files for your team
- Keep .claude/ in git for team consistency
- Re-run bootstrap if stack changes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Agent doesn't respond?**
- Check `.claude/agents/project-bootstrap.md` exists
- Try: "Use the project-bootstrap agent"

**Config doesn't fit?**
- Re-run with different answers
- Manually edit CLAUDE.md
- Delete unwanted subagents
